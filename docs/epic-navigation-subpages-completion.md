# Complete Navigation Sub-Pages - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Implement all missing sub-page routes for Extended Schools and School Council sections to make the existing navigation fully functional and provide complete information access for parents and students.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Fully functional BilingualNav with dropdown menus, existing page patterns for classes and main sections
- **Technology stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, bilingual content approach
- **Integration points:** Navigation component already references all routes, existing page layout patterns, consistent bilingual text hierarchy

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Creating 10 missing page routes with appropriate bilingual content following existing patterns (6 Extended Schools + 4 School Council sub-pages)
- **How it integrates:** Uses existing App Router structure, follows established component patterns and bilingual content approach
- **Success criteria:** All navigation links functional, consistent user experience, proper bilingual content presentation

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Create Extended Schools Landing Page and Sub-Pages - Implement `/extended-schools` main page and 6 activity sub-pages (breakfast-club, football, art-club, ict-club, maths-club, iveagh-centre)

2. **Story 2:** Create School Council Sub-Pages - Implement 4 school council sub-pages (who-we-are, work, short-term-goals, long-term-goals)

3. **Story 3:** Content Integration and Testing - Add appropriate bilingual content, ensure responsive design, and verify all navigation links work correctly

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (static pages only)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (no database involved)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (using established components and layouts)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (static page generation)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Navigation inconsistency or broken routing
- **Mitigation:** Follow existing page patterns exactly, test all navigation paths
- **Rollback Plan:** Remove new page directories, navigation already handles missing routes gracefully

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All linting checks pass (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All tests pass (existing and new test coverage)
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (navigation, bilingual patterns, responsive design)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (BilingualNav, all sub-page routes)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (component usage, content structure)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (all existing pages and navigation continue working)

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation required (following existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing patterns (bilingual content, component structure)
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (page creation, content addition)

### Risk Assessment
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (additive only)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (remove new directories)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality (navigation testing)
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing codebase patterns)

### Completeness Check
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped (Extended Schools pages, School Council pages, testing)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (functional navigation links, consistent UX)
- [x] Dependencies are identified (existing component patterns, BilingualNav structure)

## Story Manager Handoff

**For Story Development:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Integration points: BilingualNav component (already configured), App Router structure, existing layout patterns
- Existing patterns to follow: Bilingual content hierarchy (Irish first, English second), responsive card layouts, consistent typography
- Critical compatibility requirements: Must follow existing page structure, use established component library, maintain accessibility standards
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering complete navigation functionality for Extended Schools and School Council sections."
