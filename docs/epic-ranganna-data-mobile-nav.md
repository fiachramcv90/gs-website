# Ár Ranganna Data Integration & Mobile Navigation Enhancement - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Integrate authentic class curriculum data from Gaelscoil na bhFál stakeholders to replace placeholder content and enhance mobile navigation experience, providing parents and students with accurate, accessible class information across all devices.

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

- **Current relevant functionality:** Bilingual website with "Ár Ranganna / Our Classes" section containing placeholder data, existing BilingualNav component with mobile menu
- **Technology stack:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI primitives
- **Integration points:** BilingualNav component, class page routing, responsive layout system, bilingual content patterns

### Enhancement Details

- **What's being added/changed:** Replace placeholder class data with real curriculum information for Naí-Aonad through Rang 7, improve mobile navigation UX/UI
- **How it integrates:** Update existing class page components to display structured curriculum data, enhance BilingualNav mobile responsiveness
- **Success criteria:** All class pages show accurate teacher names, topics, important information, and useful websites; mobile navigation provides improved user experience

## Stories

1. **Story 1:** Integrate Real Class Curriculum Data - Replace placeholder content with authentic Gaelscoil na bhFál class information including teachers, topics, important details, and resources for all year groups (Naí-Aonad through Rang 7)

2. **Story 2:** Enhance Mobile Navigation Experience - Improve BilingualNav component's mobile interface for better usability, accessibility, and visual design on mobile devices

3. **Story 3:** Validate Data Integration & Mobile UX - Ensure all class data displays correctly across devices, mobile navigation functions smoothly, and bilingual patterns are maintained

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged (no APIs in current system)
- [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (static content, no database)
- [x] UI changes follow existing patterns (maintain bilingual hierarchy, shadcn/ui components)
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (static content updates, CSS optimizations)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing bilingual content patterns or responsive layout on mobile devices
- **Mitigation:** Follow established Irish-first/English-second pattern, test across multiple device sizes, use existing component patterns
- **Rollback Plan:** Git version control allows immediate revert to placeholder content and original navigation if issues arise

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All linting checks pass (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] All tests pass (existing and new test coverage)
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (navigation, bilingual patterns, responsive design)
- [ ] Integration points working correctly (BilingualNav, class pages, mobile layout)
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately (component usage, content structure)
- [ ] No regression in existing features (all existing pages and navigation continue working)

## Validation Checklist

### Scope Validation
- [x] Epic can be completed in 3 stories maximum
- [x] No architectural documentation required (follows existing patterns)
- [x] Enhancement follows existing patterns (bilingual content, component structure)
- [x] Integration complexity is manageable (content updates, CSS improvements)

### Risk Assessment
- [x] Risk to existing system is low (content and styling changes only)
- [x] Rollback plan is feasible (Git version control)
- [x] Testing approach covers existing functionality (cross-device testing)
- [x] Team has sufficient knowledge of integration points (existing codebase patterns)

### Completeness Check
- [x] Epic goal is clear and achievable
- [x] Stories are properly scoped (data integration, mobile UX, validation)
- [x] Success criteria are measurable (accurate content display, improved mobile experience)
- [x] Dependencies are identified (stakeholder PDF data, existing component structure)

## Story Manager Handoff

**For Story Development:**

"Please develop detailed user stories for this brownfield epic. Key considerations:

- This is an enhancement to an existing system running Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Integration points: BilingualNav component, class page routing (/ranganna), responsive layout system
- Existing patterns to follow: Irish-first/English-second bilingual content hierarchy, shadcn/ui component usage, mobile-first responsive design
- Critical compatibility requirements: Maintain bilingual patterns, preserve existing navigation functionality, ensure mobile responsiveness across all devices
- Each story must include verification that existing functionality remains intact (navigation, responsiveness, bilingual content flow)

The epic should maintain system integrity while delivering accurate class information and improved mobile navigation experience for Gaelscoil na bhFál community."
