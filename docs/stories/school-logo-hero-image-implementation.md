  alt="P√°ist√≠ ag foghlaim ag Gaelscoil na bhF√°l / Students learning at Gaelscoil na bhF√°l"
  width={800}
  height={400}
  className="w-full h-[400px] object-cover"
  priority
/>
```

## Agent Assignment Strategy

### Phase 1: UX Expert Tasks
- [ ] **Image Selection**: Review 14 school photos and select best candidates for hero banner
- [ ] **Image Editing**: Crop/resize school logo for navigation (40x40px optimal)
- [ ] **Hero Banner Composition**: Edit selected photo(s) for 800x400px hero banner
- [ ] **Asset Optimization**: Prepare web-optimized versions of all images
- [ ] **Design QA**: Ensure visual consistency with existing design system

### Phase 2: Developer Tasks  
- [ ] **File Organization**: Move processed images to `public/images/` directory
- [ ] **Logo Implementation**: Replace navigation placeholder with actual logo
- [ ] **Hero Banner Implementation**: Replace homepage placeholder with processed hero image
- [ ] **Responsive Testing**: Verify images work across all device sizes
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Ensure Next.js image optimization is working
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Implement proper bilingual alt text
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Verify no existing functionality is broken

## Definition of Done

- [ ] School logo replaces "G" placeholder in navigation header
- [ ] Appropriate hero image(s) replace homepage placeholder 
- [ ] Images are responsive and optimized via Next.js Image component
- [ ] Bilingual alt text follows existing Irish/English pattern
- [ ] Navigation functionality unchanged and regression tested
- [ ] Homepage layout and functionality unchanged
- [ ] Image files properly organized in project structure
- [ ] Any required image editing/cropping completed
- [ ] Performance metrics maintained or improved
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Performance Impact**: Large image files could slow page load
- **Design Inconsistency**: Images might not fit existing visual design
- **Responsive Issues**: Images might not display properly on all devices

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Maintain existing responsive classes and patterns
- Test across multiple device sizes and browsers

### Rollback Plan
- Simple file replacement to restore placeholders if needed
- Git revert to previous working state
- Original placeholder code preserved in comments

## Success Metrics

- **Visual Quality**: Professional appearance matching school branding
- **Performance**: No degradation in page load times
- **Accessibility**: Proper alt text and responsive behavior
- **Functionality**: All existing features continue to work unchanged

## Notes for Agent Handoff

1. **UX Expert**: Focus on image selection and editing first - the logo and hero banner are the priority items
2. **Developer**: Implementation should follow existing Next.js patterns exactly
3. **Testing**: Pay special attention to responsive behavior and bilingual accessibility
4. **File Management**: Ensure proper organization from docs/images to public/images

## UX Expert Review - Implementation Quality Issues

**Reviewed by**: UX Expert (Sally)  
**Review Date**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: üö® **REQUIRES REWORK** - Significant quality issues identified

### üö® **Critical Quality Issues Found:**

#### **1. Logo Implementation - POOR QUALITY**
- **Severe Pixelation**: The 40x40px logo is extremely low resolution and pixelated
- **Unprofessional Appearance**: Current logo looks blurry and unprofessional in navigation
- **Poor Scaling Method**: Original logo was heavily downsampled, losing all detail and clarity
- **Technical Issues**: 
  - Using both `w-10 h-10` AND `width={40} height={40}` is redundant
  - `object-cover` with `rounded-full` on square logo may cause distortion
  - No proper retina display handling implemented

#### **2. Hero Image Implementation - COMPOSITION PROBLEMS**
- **Poor Cropping**: The 800x400px crop doesn't follow UX specifications properly
- **Loss of Visual Focus**: Composition doesn't emphasize the intended 60/40 playground/building balance
- **Aspect Ratio Distortion**: Aggressive cropping may have distorted original proportions
- **Missing Visual Hierarchy**: Current crop doesn't create the intended visual flow

#### **3. Overall Professional Standards - NOT MET**
- **Brand Representation**: Current implementation doesn't represent the school professionally
- **User Experience Impact**: Poor image quality negatively affects user perception
- **Design System Consistency**: Implementation doesn't maintain design system standards

### üîß **Required Fixes - MUST BE ADDRESSED:**

#### **Logo Fixes (CRITICAL):**
1. **Use Higher Resolution Source**: Start with at least 200x200px before scaling to 40x40px
2. **Proper PNG Optimization**: Ensure crisp edges and proper transparency handling
3. **Implement Retina Support**: Use proper srcSet for high-DPI displays (40x40 + 80x80)
4. **Clean CSS Implementation**: Remove redundant sizing declarations
5. **Anti-aliasing**: Ensure smooth edges at small sizes

#### **Hero Image Fixes (HIGH PRIORITY):**
1. **Re-crop with Precision**: Follow original UX specifications exactly
   - Left 60%: Active playground scene with children
   - Right 40%: School building and background
   - Maintain natural proportions
2. **Improve Composition**: Ensure visual balance between playground activity and school building
3. **Quality Check**: Use less aggressive compression to maintain image clarity
4. **Responsive Verification**: Test across all viewport sizes

#### **Technical Implementation Fixes:**
1. **Proper Next.js Image Optimization**: Implement correct responsive image patterns
2. **CSS Cleanup**: Remove conflicting or redundant styles
3. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure proper lazy loading and optimization
4. **Accessibility Verification**: Confirm alt text renders correctly across screen readers

### üìã **Re-implementation Requirements:**

#### **New Logo Specifications:**
```css
/* Corrected Implementation */
.logo-container {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  position: relative;
}

/* Use Next.js Image with proper srcSet */
<Image
  src="/images/logos/logo-40x40.png"
  srcSet="/images/logos/logo-40x40.png 1x, /images/logos/logo-80x80.png 2x"
  alt="Suaithe√°ntas Gaelscoil na bhF√°l / Gaelscoil na bhF√°l Logo"
  width={40}
  height={40}
  className="rounded-full"
  priority
/>
```

#### **New Hero Image Specifications:**
- **Re-process P-230.jpg** with careful attention to composition
- **Crop Coordinates**: Focus on left-center playground area while maintaining building visibility
- **Quality Settings**: Use 90% JPEG quality instead of aggressive compression
- **Dimensions**: Maintain exact 800x400px with proper aspect ratio preservation

### üéØ **Acceptance Criteria - UPDATED:**

The following acceptance criteria are **NOT MET** and require re-implementation:

- ‚ùå **AC1**: Logo replacement - Current implementation is poor quality and unprofessional
- ‚ùå **AC2**: Hero banner replacement - Composition doesn't follow specifications
- ‚ùå **AC3**: Proper optimization - Images are over-compressed and poorly processed
- ‚ùå **AC7**: Professional appearance - Current implementation looks unprofessional

### üìù **Developer Action Required:**

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Stop current implementation branch
2. **RE-PROCESS**: Create new high-quality logo and hero images following updated specifications
3. **RE-IMPLEMENT**: Update code with proper Next.js Image patterns
4. **VERIFY**: Test on multiple devices and screen densities before review
5. **QA CHECK**: Ensure professional visual quality before submission

**This implementation cannot proceed to production in its current state.**
