# Story 1: Integrate Real Class Curriculum Data - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **parent or prospective parent of a Gaelscoil na bhFál student**,
I want **to view authentic class information including teachers, curriculum topics, important notes, and useful resources for each year group**,
So that **I can understand what my child will learn and what support they need for each class level**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing class page components and routing structure
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, React components, static content
- Follows pattern: Bilingual content hierarchy (Irish primary, English secondary)
- Touch points: Class page components, potentially navigation links

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. All 8 class levels (Naí-Aonad, Rang 1-7) display authentic curriculum data from stakeholder PDF
2. Each class page shows: teacher names, classroom assistants, term topics (Irish/English), important information, useful websites
3. Content maintains bilingual presentation pattern (Irish first, English translation)

### Integration Requirements
4. Existing class page routing continues to work unchanged
5. New content follows existing bilingual content pattern  
6. Integration with navigation system maintains current behavior

### Quality Requirements
7. Content is accessible and properly formatted across all device sizes
8. All links and resources are functional
9. No regression in existing page layout or navigation verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Update existing class page components with structured data objects
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow established Irish-first/English-second content hierarchy used throughout site
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain responsive design and accessibility standards

## Class Data Structure Required

Based on stakeholder PDF, each class needs:

### Data Fields
- **Class Name:** Naí-Aonad, Rang 1, Rang 2, etc.
- **Teacher(s):** Múinteoir(í)/Teacher(s)
- **Classroom Assistant(s):** Cúntóir(í)/Classroom Assistant(s)
- **Important Information:** Rudaí tábhachtacha/Important Information
- **Term Topics:** Téamaí/Topics (6 terms per year: 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 2:2, 3:1, 3:2)
- **Useful Websites:** Suíomhanna atá úsáideach/Useful Websites

### Sample Data Structure (Naí-Aonad)
```typescript
{
  className: "Naí-Aonad",
  teacher: "Margaret",
  assistants: ["Brónagh", "Caolán", "Laoise"],
  importantInfo: {
    irish: "Labhair le do pháiste i nGaeilge...",
    english: "Talk to your child in Irish..."
  },
  terms: [
    {
      term: "1:1",
      topic: {
        irish: "Ainmhithe Mór agus Beag",
        english: "All Creatures Great and Small"
      }
    },
    // ... 5 more terms
  ],
  websites: [
    "https://www.librariesni.org.uk/",
    // ... more websites
  ]
}
```

### Agent Model Used
Claude Sonnet 4 (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Created comprehensive class data structure in `/lib/class-data.ts`
- [x] Updated classes page to use authentic data from stakeholder PDF
- [x] Completely rewrote individual class pages with real curriculum information
- [x] Implemented bilingual content display (Irish first, English second)
- [x] Added proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- [x] Created test file for data validation
- [x] Verified build and routing functionality

### File List
#### Modified Files
- `app/classes/page.tsx` - Updated to use real class data from lib
- `app/classes/[slug]/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite with authentic curriculum data

#### New Files
- `lib/class-data.ts` - Comprehensive class data structure with authentic information
- `__tests__/class-data.test.ts` - Test coverage for data validation

### Change Log
1. **Data Structure Creation** - Built comprehensive TypeScript interface and data for all 8 classes with authentic information from stakeholder PDF
2. **Classes Page Update** - Modified main classes page to display real teacher names instead of placeholder descriptions
3. **Individual Class Pages** - Complete rewrite to show:
   - Authentic teacher names and classroom assistants
   - Real important information in both Irish and English
   - Actual term topics (6 per year) with bilingual titles
   - Functional useful websites from stakeholder document
4. **Type Safety** - Added proper TypeScript interfaces and helper functions
5. **Testing** - Created test suite to validate data integrity and bilingual patterns

### Completion Notes
- All 8 class levels (Naí-Aonad through Rang 7) now display authentic curriculum data from Gaelscoil na bhFál stakeholder PDF
- Maintained existing bilingual content hierarchy (Irish primary, English secondary)
- All external website links are functional and properly formatted
- Build process generates static pages for all class routes successfully
- Linting passes with no errors (only pre-existing warnings in other files)
- Manual testing confirms routing and content display work correctly

### Debug Log References
- No debugging issues encountered
- Build successful on first attempt
- All manual validation tests passed

**Status:** Ready for Review

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Breaking existing bilingual content patterns or component structure
**Mitigation:** Follow established data patterns, test with existing components
**Rollback:** Git revert to placeholder content if integration issues arise

## Files Likely to be Modified

- Class page components (check existing structure)
- Data files or constants for class information
- Potentially routing configuration if new class levels added
- CSS/styling if layout adjustments needed
