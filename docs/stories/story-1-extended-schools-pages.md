# Story 1: Create Extended Schools Landing Page and Sub-Pages - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a **parent or prospective parent of a Gaelscoil na bhFál student**,
I want **to access detailed information about all Extended Schools activities including breakfast club, sports, arts, and learning clubs**,
So that **I can understand what additional opportunities are available for my child and how to enroll them**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: BilingualNav component (routes already configured), existing App Router structure
- Technology: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- Follows pattern: Bilingual content hierarchy (Irish primary, English secondary), responsive card layouts
- Touch points: Navigation dropdowns, existing page layout patterns, route generation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. Create `/extended-schools` main landing page with overview of all 6 activities
2. Create 6 individual sub-pages: `/extended-schools/breakfast-club`, `/extended-schools/football`, `/extended-schools/art-club`, `/extended-schools/ict-club`, `/extended-schools/maths-club`, `/extended-schools/iveagh-centre`
3. All pages display appropriate bilingual content (Irish first, English second)

### Integration Requirements
4. Existing BilingualNav dropdown functionality continues to work unchanged
5. New pages follow existing layout patterns and component usage
6. Integration with App Router generates proper static routes

### Quality Requirements
7. All pages are responsive and accessible across mobile, tablet, and desktop
8. Content follows established typography and spacing patterns
9. No regression in existing navigation or page functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Create App Router directory structure under `/app/extended-schools/` with individual sub-directories for each activity
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow class pages pattern for layout structure and bilingual content display
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain existing navigation behavior and responsive design standards

## Page Structure Required

### Landing Page Content (`/extended-schools`)
- **Page Title:** Scoileanna Sínte / Extended Schools
- **Overview:** Brief description of extended schools program
- **Activity Cards:** Visual cards linking to each of the 6 activities
- **Contact Information:** How to inquire or enroll

### Sub-Page Content Structure
Each activity page should include:
- **Activity Name:** Bilingual title
- **Description:** What the activity involves
- **Schedule:** When it takes place
- **Age Groups:** Which classes can participate
- **Contact:** How to sign up or get more information

### Sample Page Structure
```typescript
// Extended Schools Activity Data
{
  name: {
    irish: "Cumann Bricfeasta",
    english: "Breakfast Club"
  },
  description: {
    irish: "Cumann le béile maith a fháil roimh scoil",
    english: "A club to get a good meal before school"
  },
  schedule: {
    irish: "Gach maidin scoile ó 8:00 go 8:45",
    english: "Every school morning from 8:00 to 8:45"
  },
  ageGroups: {
    irish: "Naí-Aonad go Rang 7",
    english: "Nursery to Year 7"
  },
  contact: {
    irish: "Déan teagmháil leis an oifig",
    english: "Contact the office"
  }
}
```

## Definition of Done

- [x] Extended Schools landing page created with overview and navigation to all activities
- [x] All 6 sub-pages created: breakfast-club, football, art-club, ict-club, maths-club, iveagh-centre
- [x] Bilingual content pattern maintained (Irish/English) across all pages
- [x] **All linting checks pass (`npm run lint`)**
- [x] **All existing tests continue to pass**
- [x] **New test coverage added for route generation**
- [x] Existing BilingualNav dropdown functionality verified
- [x] Content displays correctly across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- [x] All navigation links from dropdown menu work correctly
- [x] Pages follow established layout and component patterns
- [x] Static route generation working for all new pages
- [ ] **QA Review completed and approved**

## Risk Assessment

**Primary Risk:** Breaking existing navigation dropdown or route generation
**Mitigation:** Follow established App Router patterns, test all navigation paths
**Rollback:** Remove new directories, navigation already handles missing routes gracefully

## Files Likely to be Modified

### New Directories/Files to Create
- `/app/extended-schools/page.tsx` - Landing page
- `/app/extended-schools/breakfast-club/page.tsx`
- `/app/extended-schools/football/page.tsx`
- `/app/extended-schools/art-club/page.tsx`
- `/app/extended-schools/ict-club/page.tsx`
- `/app/extended-schools/maths-club/page.tsx`
- `/app/extended-schools/iveagh-centre/page.tsx`

### Potential Data Files
- `/lib/extended-schools-data.ts` - Activity information structure
- Test files for route and content validation

### No Modifications Needed
- `components/bilingual-nav.tsx` - Already configured for these routes
- Existing navigation or layout components

---

**Epic:** [Complete Navigation Sub-Pages](../epic-navigation-subpages-completion.md)
**Story Type:** Brownfield Addition
**Estimated Effort:** Medium (page creation and content structuring)
**Dependencies:** Existing component patterns, BilingualNav configuration
