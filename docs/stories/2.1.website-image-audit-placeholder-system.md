# Story 2.1: Website Image Audit & Placeholder System Implementation - Brownfield Enhancement

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** website visitor and content manager for Gaelscoil na bhFál,
**I want** a comprehensive image management system with appropriate placeholder images for all missing visual content,
**so that** the website presents a complete, professional appearance while providing a foundation for future authentic image integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Image Audit Requirements
1. All missing images are identified across the entire website (home page, news, school council, contact, classes)
2. Current image references are documented with their intended content and placement
3. Broken image paths and missing assets are catalogued with priority levels

### Placeholder Image System Requirements  
4. Appropriate placeholder images are created or sourced for each identified missing image
5. Placeholder images respect the bilingual Irish cultural context and are appropriate for a Gaelscoil
6. Image organization structure follows established project patterns with proper naming conventions

### Technical Implementation Requirements
7. All placeholder images use Next.js Image component instead of direct img tags (resolving ESLint warnings)
8. Images are optimized for web delivery with appropriate sizing and compression
9. Proper alt text is provided in bilingual format (Irish/English) for accessibility

### Infrastructure Requirements
10. Public directory structure is created and organized according to coding standards
11. Image categories are properly structured (school-photos, events, staff, etc.)
12. File naming conventions follow established project patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Based on previous story completion notes:
- Project uses Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- ESLint warnings about img tags have been noted but not resolved
- Build process succeeds but with image optimization warnings
- Bilingual patterns (Irish/English) must be maintained throughout

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: coding-standards.md#File-Organization-Standards]
- Images should be stored in /public directory (currently missing)
- Follow kebab-case naming for files and directories
- Organize by content type: school-photos/, events/, staff/, classes/

### Image Optimization Standards  
[Source: coding-standards.md#Image-Optimization]
- **MUST use Next.js Image component**: `import Image from "next/image"`
- **Avoid direct img tags**: Causes ESLint warnings currently present in build
- Include proper width/height attributes for optimization
- Use responsive sizing with className for Tailwind CSS styling

### Current Missing Images Identified
[Source: Codebase audit]
1. **Home Page**: `/irish-school-children-learning-in-classroom-with-i.jpg` (hero image)
2. **News Articles**:
   - `/irish-children-celebrating-irish-language-week.jpg`
   - `/irish-school-children-playing-football.jpg` 
   - `/irish-school-children-doing-science-experiments.jpg`
3. **School Council**: 4 member photos with descriptive names
4. **Contact Staff**: 3 staff members currently using `/placeholder.svg?key=staff[1-3]`

### Bilingual Content Requirements
[Source: coding-standards.md#Bilingual-Content-Guidelines]
- Alt text must follow pattern: "Irish description / English description"
- Images should respect Irish cultural context
- Maintain Irish-first/English-secondary hierarchy in descriptions

### File Naming Conventions
[Source: coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]
- Use kebab-case for all image files
- Descriptive names reflecting content (e.g., `hero-school-children-learning.jpg`)
- Include content type in path structure

### Technical Constraints
[Source: Architecture analysis]
- No backend/database - static site approach
- Must maintain existing responsive design patterns
- Follow established Tailwind CSS utility classes
- TypeScript interfaces may need updates for image props

### Testing Standards

**Testing Requirements**:
- No formal test framework configured for images currently
- Manual validation across device types required
- Accessibility testing with screen reader compatibility  
- Cross-browser validation for image loading
- Performance impact assessment (build size, load times)

**Validation Approach**:
- Visual regression testing manually across all pages
- Responsive behavior validation (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility audit for proper alt text implementation
- Build process validation to ensure no new warnings
